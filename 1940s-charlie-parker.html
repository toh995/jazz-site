                <p>
                    Our musician for the 1940s is <em><strong>Charlie Parker</strong></em>!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Charlie Parker was an alto saxophonist and leading innovator of the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebop" target="_blank">bebop</a> style of jazz in the 1940s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bebop was revolutionary for its time - it was characterized by fast tempos, frequent key changes,
                    and a
                    new harmonic complexity
                    that no one had ever seen before (or heard before). Before bebop, jazz was fun and simple, played to
                    a
                    danceable beat so
                    that the average person could listen and enjoy dancing to the music. However, bebop was the first
                    time
                    jazz became an
                    abstract, intellectual art form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As one of the principal architects of the bebop language, Charlie Parker influenced many, many jazz
                    musicians that came after him.
                    Much of his vocabulary became integrated into jazz music beyond the 1940s - concepts like the

                        substitution</a>
                    and

                        chords</a>.
