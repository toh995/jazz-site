# ALL ABOUT JAZZ
This is a [simple website about jazz](https://toh995.github.io/jazz-site/index.html) that I made using pure HTML and CSS. It's just a small project to practice some fundamentals on.

The "Contact Us" page is not fully functional at the moment - maybe I'll make it do something cool in the future.

## Skills practiced
### HTML
- Basic HTML
- Creating hyperlinks
- Embedding images and audio

### CSS
- Implementing the [BEM methodology](http://getbem.com/introduction/)
- Flexbox and Grid layout
- Sticky positioning
- Styling different link states
