                <p>
                    Our musician for the 1960s is <em><strong>Miles Davis</strong></em>!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Miles Davis was a trumpeter and pioneer of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-bop" target="_blank">post-bop</a> style of jazz.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Post-bop represents a slight departure from both the <a href="1940s-charlie-parker.html" target="_blank">bebop of the 1940s</a> and
                    the <a href="1950s-art-blakey.html" target="_blank">hard bop of the 1950s</a>. Post-bop had less structure than the music before it -
                    harmonically, rhythmically, and melodically. Post-bop musicians would often switch between different rhythmic meters mid-song,
                    or they'd sometimes perform free improvisations with no pre-determined rhtyhms, harmonies, or melodies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the 1960s, Miles Davis's most well-known group was known as the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis_Quintet#Second_Great_Quintet_(1964%E2%80%9368)" target="_blank">Second Great Quintet</a>.
                    (His First Great Quintet was active in the 1950s and performed in the hard bop idiom.) The group produced many seminal recordings
                    throughout the 1960s that featured great musical fluidity, where each bandmember contributed to the group as equals instead of
                    following the traditional leader-backup musician dichotomy. In the recording &quot;Nefertiti&quot; below, you can hear that
                    towards the end of the song, the horns and the rest of the band switch roles, where the horns act as the backup musicians,
                    while the drummer, bassist, and pianist act as lead soloists. This is just one example of the free experimentation executed
                    by the band.
